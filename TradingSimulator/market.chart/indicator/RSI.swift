    /*
     * Developed by Tushard Chande and Stanley Kroll, StochRSI is an oscillator that measures
     * the level of RSI relative to its high-low range over a set time period.
     * StochRSI applies the Stochastics formula to RSI values, instead of price values.
     * This makes it an indicator of an indicator. The result is an oscillator that fluctuates between 0 and 1.
     *
     * In their 1994 book, The New Technical Trader, Chande and Kroll explain that RSI can oscillate between 80 and 20
     * for extended periods without reaching extreme levels.
     *
     * Notice that 80 and 20 are used for overbought and oversold instead of the more traditional 70 and 30.
     * Traders looking to enter a stock based on an overbought or oversold reading in RSI might find themselves
     * continuously on the sidelines. Chande and Kroll developed StochRSI to increase sensitivity and generate
     *  more overbought/oversold signals.
